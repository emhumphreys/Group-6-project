    <p>So you've made the great decision to become self sustainable and grow your own fruit, vegetable and flowers, so what now?  With so many options of what to grow, and wondering how to get started, it can be a little overwhelming.  Below are some great examples of what can be grown, whether you have as much room for growing as a field, or as little space as a window box.  If you're short on space, maybe consider looking into getting an allotment.  These are spaces rented out, often for only a nominal annual fee, where you can create your growing patch.  Details of spaces available can be obtained from your local council. Also, with compost, seeds and tools being readily available in supermarkets, it's never been easier or more convenient to start growing. </p>

              <li><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> How to grow: Rather than from seed, potatoes are grown from tubers that have been 'chitted'.  Plant your tubers around 5in deep; once the shoots start to emerge, you need to 'earth' them buy adding more compost on top.  Repeat this process several times.  As a rough guide, potatoes take around 12 weeks to fully grow.</li>
              <li><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> Recipe suggestions: Potatoes can be boiled, roasted, mashed or made into chips.  They are a great source of potassium and vitamin C.</li>

Sow your seeds around 1cm deep and lay them on their side to reduce the risk of the seed rotting.  After the last chance of frost has passed, harden the plants off by placing them outdoors during the daytime and then returning them inside at night-time.  Do this for one week before planting into their final positions.  Water regularly and as the pumpkin grows, ensure it is adequately supported and not on wet earth to reduce the risk of it rotting.</li>

Courgettes can grow into quite large plants so ensure that plants are placed arounf 45cm apart.  Water regularly and feed every week or two with a high-potassium liquid feed.  Harvest as soon as they are ready as this will encourage more growth on the plant.</li>
              <li><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> Recipe suggestions: Chop and roast your courgettes for a tasy side dish or if you fancy something sweeter, try a courgette cake!</li>

Heat aids germination so place your pots in a warm, sunny spot.  As peppers require full sun and warmth, growing in a greenhouse or on a kitchen window sill is a better option than growing outdoors.  As the roots of  your plants fill the bottom of the pot, move them into a larger pot with more compost.  Water regularly, however take care not to over water.  Your plants may require staking if there are many or large pepppers.   Harvest when the colour turns from green, picking as soon as possible gives your plant more time to develop more fruit.</li>

Wind pollination is required for your sweetcorn plants, a trick is to tap the tops of the plant when the male flowers appear, the pollen can them pollinate the female flowers.  When the stringy ends of your cobs turn brown this a sign that your sweetcorn is ready for harvesting. Peel back the husk and check that the cob is fully ripe before removing from the plant.<</li>

              <li><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> How to grow: Sow seeds around 1cm deep in small pots and water well.  Sunflowers like to grow in a sunny spot, in well drained soil.  Protect your seedlings from slugs and snails by placing coppers rings around the base of your plants.  As they can reach heights of 4 metres and the sunflower head can become heavy, it is essential to have supports in place to tie your plant into.  If you choose not to pick your sunflowers, the seed head will eventually dry out and the birds will love collecting the seeds.</li>
              <li><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> Recipe suggestions: A recent trend has been to grill a sunflower head and season with herbs and spices.  Why not give it a go, it will definitely be a talking point at your summer BBQ!</li>
